# BrandWorth Consulting Project (67-373)

This repository contains documentation and resources for the BrandWorth LLC consulting engagement, completed as part of the 67-373: Information Systems Consulting course at Carnegie Mellon University.

Our project aimed to design, develop, and deliver a semi-automated Airtable-based valuation platform for BrandWorth to help them to streamline the process of evaluating brand strength and estimating company value.
